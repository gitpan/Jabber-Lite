Jabber::Lite is a Jabber connection and XML stanza processing library
implemented entirely in perl.  Originally written to act as a Jabber
client on old, non-upgradable perl versions, it has grown into a more 
generic library.  From the DESCRIPTION in perldoc:

       Whats in the box?  Jabber::Lite is able to connect to a
       Jabber server, read from the socket, and supply XML
       objects to the application as the application reads them.
       Its function calls are mostly compatible with Jab-
       ber::NodeFactory and Jabber::Connection.  Surprisingly, it
       can also function as a stand-alone XML parser (which was
       not the author's original intent, but hey, it works).

       Whats not in the box?  Any requirement for a recent perl
       version, UTF-8 support, as well as a fully XML-compliant
       Parser.
